# PyBer_Analysis

## **OVERVIEW**

*The purpose of this anaylsis was to present a summary and multi-line graph of the ride-sharing data by city type to show how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.*


 ## **RESULTS**

*The results definitely indicate that each city type is very unique in the number of riders, number of drivers and the fare totals.  
The data shows that the total rides in urban cities were 1,625, which is more than double the rural and ruburban rides combined. (Rural cities,125 & Suburban cities, 625)
Urban cities also made up the overwhelming majority of drivers with a total of 2405 vs. 78 in rural cities and 490 in suburban cities. 
The total revenue of fares was $39,854.38 for urban cities, $19,356.33 for suburban cities and $4,327.93
However, the average fares in rural and suburban cities were both higher at $34.62 (rural) and $30.97 (suburban), compared to $24.53 in urban cities. 
Similarly, the average fare per driver in rural cities was $55.49 compared to $39.50 in suburban cities and only $16.57 in urban cities.*

*Based of the Total Fares by City Type from January to April of 2019, it shows that urban cities consistently bring in the most revenue, even when all fares dropped the week of April 7th. Rural cities seem to have the most consistency without a lot of flucuation. January seems to be the slowest month in urban cities, where suburban cities seem slower in March. Both urban and suburban cities seem to be trending upwards in April, so it would be interesting to see the data for the rest of 2019.*

## **SUMMARY**

*My recommendations would start with looking at what happened the week of April 7th. Fares were severely affected in urban and suburban cities and I would want to understand why to avoid this in future months, or ever April if the cause was a annual event of some sort.* 

*The week of April 7th was the lowest Fare Totals for both urban and suburban cities, as indidcated in red in this graphic. However, the week of February 24th, all city types reported the highest Fare Totals, which is highlight in blue.* [Per Week Total Fare Summary](https://github.com/allibartlett-27/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Per%20Week%20Fare%20Totals.png)

*Urban cities give more rides and have more drivers but because the supply is higher, the average rate is much lower than urban and suburban cities. I would recommend additional analysis on why this is. For example, it could be due to shorter rides, so I would suggest runnnig further data on length of rides, or distance of rides to see if this correlates with the lower rates. Urban cities also tend to have a greater mix of incomes, which could also affect the rate. If you increased the rate in urban cities by 5%, would the total number of rides decrease?* 

*Another thing to consider is where riders are riding to? For example, if 75% of rides in an urban city like New York City are getting rides to the airport, or to tourist attractions, you could consider adding a premium rate factor on those destinations to drive a higher rate per ride for those urban cities.* 

*It would also be helpful to run the Total Fares by city type by individual day of the week. I would think that weekend dates have higher total fares compared to weekdays. How do the rates of rides compare from weekend rates to weekday rates. If there is a higher count of rides on weekend days but fares are lower or the same, this could be an opportunity.*
